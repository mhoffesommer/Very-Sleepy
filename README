Initial build
=============

Easy
----
Run one of the easy_build batch files.

wxwidgets
---------
Run C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\bin\vcvcars32.bat
   (or vcvarsx86_amd64.bat for a 64-bit cross-compile)
   (or vcvars64.bat for a regular 64-bit build)
Now, from the wxwindows\build\msw directory:

   nmake -f makefile.vc BUILD=debug SHARED=0 RUNTIME_LIBS=static

For a release build, use BUILD=release instead
For 64-bit, add TARGET_CPU=AMD64
